# Analysis of forest fire

## About
Forest fire can be very dangerous as it can destroy wildlife, timber and homes. It emits gases which are very harmhul for humans and also for nature. It produces CO2 which is the main cause of global warming.

## Implementation :-
I will use the dataset provided by UCI Machine learning Repository (forest fires).
The aim is to predict the burned areas of forest, using the dataset. 
 
dataset link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires

I will first clean the data for the analysis(Most probably i will use python code to clean the data.). Data cleaning will remove the missing data entries.
then I will select input features and output feature for the model.
I will split the dataset into two sets 30% (test data) and 70% (training data).
Now i will apply Lasso Regression algorithm to train my model.
In python i will use pandas, numpy, matplotlib and sklearn for the implementation of various algorithms.

## Conclusion :-
This model will help in predicting the area which will be affected by the forest fire. And it will be a great help for the population living near the areas which are prone to forest fires. We can warn people before the time so that we can save lives.
